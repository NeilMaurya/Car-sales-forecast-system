<h1>Capstone Project Data Science -Business Case Study of Japanese manufacturing company</h1><br>
Prediction of indian sales data by building a model based on existing japanese sales data
I used Logistic Regression, Random Forest Classifier and CategorialNB and the three models were compared based on accuracy score and r2 score. The best model was used to predict the Indian sales and decide if the company will get enough sales to open a plant in India.
